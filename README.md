# Knight Travails

[Project Demo]( https://ztnix.github.io/Knights-Travails/)

This is a project that allows the user to visualize the shortest path for a horse/knight based on its allowed/possible moves from a starting point to a destination within the bounds of a chessboard.

Notes:

- This project's original goal was to determine the minimum number of moves needed to reach the goal. The UI was added as an extra and it's very simple and not optimized, and there are also minor bugs to fix in the future.
